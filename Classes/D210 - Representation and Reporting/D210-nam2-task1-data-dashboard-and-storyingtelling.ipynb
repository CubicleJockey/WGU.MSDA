    "Here you will find a Tableau Dashboard with 5 Navigation boxes located at the top of the dashboard. These include `Introduction`, `Who Are Our Patients`, `Hopistal Over All Ratings`, `KPIs based on Medical Condition`, and `Assessment Analysis`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Introduction*\n",
    "This section of the dashboard is where my introductions are made about me and the two datasets used within the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Who Are Our Patients*\n",
    "This interactive dashboard offers users the opportunity to delve into our patient data through interactive exploration based on gender, number of children, and marital status. The dashboard provides five filters to enable interactivity: 'Income Range', 'Gender', 'Patient Age Range', 'Marital Status', and 'By State'. These filters empower users to delve deeper into the data and request more specific information about hospital patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, utilizing these controls, you can pose a question such as \"Please provide me with details about female patients with an income range of 40,000–50,000, who are married and reside in Washington or Oregon, within the age group of 18–25.\" To accomplish this, you begin by adjusting the 'Income Range' filter, dragging the left side of the dual slider to 40,000 and the right side to 50,000. Then, you proceed to the 'Gender' filter, selecting only the Female option and clicking Apply. Moving on to the 'Patient Age Range' filter, you set the left slider to 18 and the right slider to 25. Next, you use the 'Marital Status' filter to choose only the Married option and click Apply. Finally, you utilize the 'By State' filter, selecting the checkboxes corresponding to WA and OR, and once again click Apply. Consequently, the data will be filtered to match the criteria specified in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive approach enables users to explore the data more precisely, unraveling valuable insights about our hospital's patient demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Hospitals Over All Ratings*\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive dashboard provides users with an opportunity to explore hospital ratings, categorized and color-coded by National Readmission National Comparison and Year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the dashboard, a legend is included, allowing users to highlight specific categories by clicking on the corresponding colors. Additionally, a 'By State' filter is available, enabling the selection of multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard facilitates answering queries such as: \"How many patients in Kansas, within the 'Above the national average' group, rated hospitals with a score of 2 in 2019?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the user would simply adjust the 'By State' filter to KS and click Apply. Next, by selecting the 'Above the national average' label in the legend, the associated values would be highlighted. Lastly, the user can locate the row corresponding to 2019 and the relevant Rating number to obtain the desired information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *KPIs based on Medical Conditions*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully developed an interactive dashboard to comprehensively analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) pertaining to Hospital Readmission. Our previous coursework, including D207, D208, and D209, primarily focused on the WGU medical dataset with an emphasis on readmission rates. However, due to the challenges associated with finding external datasets that align closely with our project, we decided to broaden our perspective beyond readmission alone. This expanded approach enables us to explore additional features and KPIs that have the potential to contribute to reducing a hospital's overall readmission rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the detailed examination of readmission rates by age, our analysis now encompasses the following crucial metrics: 'Readmission National Ratings', which provide insights into the national ratings related to readmission; 'Patient Experience National Average', which offers an overview of the average patient experience across the nation; 'High-blood Pressure by Age', which focuses on the prevalence of high-blood pressure within different age groups; 'Readmission by Age', which allows us to understand readmission patterns based on age; and 'Hyperlipidemia By Age', which provides valuable information on hyperlipidemia occurrences across different age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating these additional metrics into our analysis, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors impacting readmission rates and potentially identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Assessment Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a non-interactive tab within the Tableau Story Dashboard. Here you'll find the findings of the overall dashboard."
