###### Competencies:

a. Course Planning: You will create your personalized course planning tool report with your instructor.

b. Constructing Neural Networks: The student builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.

c. Time Series: The student applies time series models in generating forecasts.

d. Natural Language Processing: The student extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.

Performance Assessment (PA): Task covering the above competencies and involving:

*Task 1:* This task is on Time series. You will use either the churn or medical data set and its associated data dictionary. You will then analyze that data set using time series modeling, ARIMA, and create visualizations. You will perform ACF, PACF and Spectral Density. You will generate forecasts and deliver the results of your analysis.

*Task 2:* This task involves Sentiment Analysis using Tensorflow for a Neural Network.  You will choose a data file from the Web Links section. The available data sets include Amazon Product Data set, UCSD Recommender Systems Data sets, and UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences Data set.  You will build a neural network designed to learn word usage and context using NLP techniques. You will provide visualizations and a report, as well as build your network in an interactive development environment.

Tools and Techniques: Python or R (Students can choose), Time Series, NN, NLP, TensorFlow, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), etc.
