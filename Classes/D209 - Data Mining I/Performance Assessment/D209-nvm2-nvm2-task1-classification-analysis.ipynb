    "\n",
    "We will continue down the path that was set forth in the second task of D208, which used logical regression. The research question that will be focused of D209 Task 1 - Classification Analysis is \"Which factors have a significant effect on readmission?\". The main goal of the classification analysis is to see if a more effective model can be created and give better details than D209 logistic regression model. The available options for this task are ['k-nearest neighbor (KNN)'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) and ['Naive Bayes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). I will be choosing *k-nearest neighbor (KNN)* to perform my classification analysis."

    "\n",
    "At the end of Task 2 of D208 Logistical Regression a few explanatory variables presented themselves as things a hospital could look at or address in regard to readmission to the hospital. Even though the model did find some items for the hospital to work on we are going to use *k-nearest neighbor (KNN)* to see if the question can be answered more detailed via this model. The goal is attempting to create a better model for the question of readmitting patients is beneficial to the patient, hospital, and the laws in place to keep hospital readmission low. The hospital's core responsibility lies in handling existing issues and averting possible future ones. By proactively and efficiently managing these concerns, the hospital can improve outcomes for its present patients, avoid extending their hospital stay, prevent readmission for the same issue, and even avert potential complications or health risks that could lead to future hospitalization."

    "\n",
    "##### k-nearest neighbor (KNN)\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen method is *k-nearest neighbor (KNN)*. \"KNN is one of the simpler prediction/classification techniques: there is no model to be fit (as in regression). This doesn't mean that using KNN is an automatic procedure. The prediction results depend on how the features are scaled, how similarity is measured, and how big *K* is set. Also, all predictors must be in numeric form.\" (Bruce, Bruce, & Gedeck, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that does not make explicit assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. In KNN, the prediction for a new data point is based on the classification or value of regression of its nearest neighbors in the training data. The value of *K* represents the number of nearest neighbors considered. *K* will remain constant as new datapoints are being introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method seems to be useful when working with the hospital data and questions as it allows new data points to be introduced and get classified to its proper section based on the surrounding data it lands by. This seems really flexible and a great way to classify out data appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantages of *KNN* include:\n",
    " - Quickest Calculation Time *(Tavva, 2020)*\n",
    " - Simple Algorithms *(Tavva, 2020)*\n",
    " - High Accuracy *(Tavva, 2020)*\n",
    " - Versatile – best use for Regression and Classification. *(Tavva, 2020)*\n",

    "# B2: Assumptions of a Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Homogeneous feature space:\n",
    "    - KNN assumes that the feature space is homogeneous, meaning that all features have the same scale and importance. If the features are not homogeneous, some features may be given more weight than others, leading to biased results. (Cover and Hart (1967))\n",
    "\n",
    " * The relevance of the distance metric:\n",
    "     * KNN relies heavily on the choice of distance metric used to measure similarity between instances. The algorithm assumes that the distance metric used is appropriate for the dataset and the problem being solved. Therefore, choosing an appropriate distance metric is critical to the performance of KNN. (Dasarathy (1991))\n",
    "\n",
    " * High dimensionality:\n",
    "     * KNN is sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, where the number of features is significantly higher than the number of instances. In high-dimensional spaces, the distance between the nearest neighbors becomes meaningless, making KNN less effective. (Aggarwal et al. (2001))\n",
    "\n",
    " * Imbalanced data:\n",
    "      * KNN assumes that the classes are equally distributed in the dataset. If the dataset is imbalanced, the algorithm may favor the majority class, leading to inaccurate results. (Batista et al. (2004))\n",
    "\n",
    " * Noisy data:\n",
    "     * KNN is susceptible to noisy data, which may introduce errors in the classification or regression process. To mitigate the effect of noisy data, preprocessing techniques such as outlier removal or noise reduction may be applied. (Wang and Wong (2008))"

This meant that the model had a high-level of accuracy and the MSE confirmed that the accuracy wasn't inaccurately describing its accuracy as the MSE was really low. When working through D209 Task 1 classification analysis I wanted to use the same question and see if k-nearest neighbor(KNN) could top or at a minimum maintain the accuracy for readmission's modeling.\n",

Those accuracies were *0.98 (98%)* for the training dataset and *0.97 (97%)* for testing dataset with regard to which factors affect hospitals' readmission. The point of the *ROC Curve* is to see how far away from the diagonal line we can get in the positive direction. This is because the diagonal line represents the 50% correct classification rate, where complete randomness would hover around this line. If the classification line falls below the diagonal line, it's a poor model, and if it goes above the diagonal line, it's a better model."

This model is a very accurate one when it comes to predicting re-admissions to the hospital. The KNN model almost couldn't be any more accurate. This is on par with the accuracy of the `logistical regression` model performed in *D208*. This model will be extremely helpful in predicting if a patient is likely to be readmitted to the hospital or not as it has reduced the features of the model to the most important ones via the `SelectKBest` functionality."

    "Enhancing discharge planning is critical in reducing readmission rates, especially for patients with multiple children and those initially admitted through emergency departments. Research indicates that the length of the first hospitalization significantly affects the likelihood of future readmission's. As such, hospitals should focus on improving their discharge planning procedures to ensure patients receive adequate preparation to manage their conditions at home. This may entail providing clear guidance on medication administration, follow-up visits, and identifying warning signs of potential complications. By improving these processes, hospitals can equip patients and their families with the necessary resources to effectively manage their health outside the hospital and ultimately reduce readmission rates, particularly for patients with multiple children and emergency department admissions."
