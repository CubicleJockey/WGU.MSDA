    "# A: Research Question\n",
    ">Summarize the original real-data research question you identified in task 1. Your summary should include justification for the research question you identified in task 1, a description of the context in which the research question exists, and a discussion of your hypothesis.\n",

    "#### Research Question:\n",
    "Is it possible to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify new content as SPAM or non-SPAM (HAM), using a dataset comprising known SPAM and regular content from the 2007 TREC Public Spam Corpus and Enron emails? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Justification:\n",
    "Spam presents a significant challenge for both businesses and households. It not only consumes valuable storage space and impedes the identification of critical emails, but it also poses a substantial security risk. Spam emails can serve as conduits for malicious threats such as viruses, worms, phishing scams, and ransomware. Therefore, implementing models capable of accurately detecting spam is essential. These models are not only crucial for enhancing security measures but also for ensuring that email server storage is reserved exclusively for important organizational communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null hypothesis (*HΦ*)**- The machine learning model developed using the 2007 TREC Public Spam Corpus and Enron emails dataset cannot accurately classify new content as SPAM or non-SPAM (HAM) with an accuracy score of 95% or higher. This implies that any observed accuracy in classification does not significantly exceed what would be expected by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternate Hypothesis (*Ha*)**- The machine learning model developed using the 2007 TREC Public Spam Corpus and Enron emails dataset can accurately classify new content as SPAM or non-SPAM (HAM) with an accuracy score of 95% or higher. This suggests that the model has learned effective patterns within the dataset, enabling it to differentiate between SPAM and non-SPAM content significantly better than chance."

    "The dataset under discussion, titled *'Spam Email Classification Dataset'*, encompasses a meticulously curated collection of email content. Each email within this dataset has been accurately categorized as either 'SPAM' or 'NOT SPAM' (often referred to as 'HAM'). This valuable compilation of data was sourced from the well-known platform, [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of the dataset is diverse, integrating data from two prominent sources: the Enron Corpus and the TREC Public Spam Corpus. This blend ensures a rich variety of email samples. One of the key features of this dataset is its pre-labeled nature. The emails, which exhibit a range of unstructured content, have been pre-classified, rendering the dataset immediately applicable for training machine learning models in spam detection and email filtering tasks. Such ready-to-use, pre-labeled datasets are instrumental in facilitating efficient model training and accurate spam classification.\n",
