# MSDA Capstone Proposal Questions:
<hr/>

### Questions
1.	What is your research question?
2.	What are your hypotheses?
3.	What are your citations from statistical research?
4.	What statistical methods did those researchers use?
5.	What attributes did they find important?
6.	Which statistical methods will you use?
   * Normality test, parametric or nonparametric test, post-hoc test.   
       * Remember you must use one or more of the eight principal statistical methods: 
         - [t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test)
         - [z-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test)
         - [ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance)
         - [Regression Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)
         - [Kruskal-Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance)
         - [Wilcoxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test)
         - [Chi-Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test)
         - [Fisherâ€™s Exact Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test)
7. Does the data fit what are you intending to do?
8. Which tool(s) will you use *(Provide in-text citations supporting your choice)*?  
      * [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
      * [Python](https://www.python.org/about/)
      * [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information/why-sas.html)  
9.	Has the data been studied statistically by other researchers? 
      * If so, what statistical methods did they use?  What were their findings?
10.	What are the limitations and delimitations of your study?
11.	What are the number of rows of data in your dataset?
       * As studies may vary, 7,000 rows is highly recommended.  Please consult with your Course Instructor if problems arise.
12.	What is the data sparsity (%)?

### Keep in Mind:
1. 	***Employers*** want to see concrete examples of evaluating business problems or cases: 
         * predict revenue
         * predict widgets based on IVs
         * miles-per-gallon
         * stock valuation
         * factors for loan approval
         * production costs
         * transportation charges
         * significant group differences in terms of valuation or market share
2.	Social conditions, avocations, or non-business problems are `NOT SUITABLE` for Capstone study.
3.	Must have in-text citation per section of your Proposal.
4.	Limitations are constraints placed upon the researcher.  
       * Spell them out.
5.	Delimitations are constraints the researcher places upon the study.
       * Spell them out.
6.	The data table is required because it demonstrates to the committee the `independent variables` (IVs) intended for study as opposed to all IVs.
7. 	Use statistical terminology throughout the proposal.  
       * The title should state the principal statistical method being used.
8.	Cite a study of your subject or similar subject that used the method you are planning to use. (Context and Project Outcome).
9.	Justification is about what other researchers say about the tool you chose, e.g., R v. SAS, R v. Python. 
       * It is about expert opinion.
