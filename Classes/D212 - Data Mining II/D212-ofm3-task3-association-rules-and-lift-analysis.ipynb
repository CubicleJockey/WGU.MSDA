    "Market Basket Analysis functions on datasets composed solely of binary values, either True or False, or 1's and 0's, distinguishing it from models that utilize continuous or ordinal data. This method is centered on finding recurring combinations of items in various transactions, enabling retailers to discern patterns in the products that customers often purchase in tandem. The anticipated results of this analysis are generally split into two parts known as Antecedents (IFs) and Consequents (THENs). These terms form the basis for conditional rules or scenarios, such as: If a customer bought a Nintendo game, they also purchased a Nintendo accessory. A fundamental concept of Market Basket Analysis, especially when employing the Apriori algorithm, is that any portion of a frequently observed itemset must itself be frequent."

This not only improves the patient experience by expediting the dispensing time but also contributes to cost reduction by enabling the Pharmacy to process more orders efficiently.\n",

This expansion should be within a reasonable scope of confidence to ensure that an antecedent (IF) is consistently paired with a consequent (THEN). This approach may uncover additional opportunities for efficiency within the Pharmacy dispensary.\n",

This will not only contribute to patient satisfaction but also support the hospital's broader objectives in Patient Relations Management.\n",
