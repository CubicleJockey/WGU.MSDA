**On pursuing your own projects**
You can enhance your data analytics skills by pursuing projects that hold significant interest for you. I completed such a project the first week of February. I envisioned a graphic that would encapsulate the student experience in each course and created the enhanced boxplots in the Days in Course PDF file. 


**On reading these boxplots**
1) The lower end of the box is the 1st quartile (Q1) -- 25% of all students completed the course in that many days or less and 75% took longer to complete the course.
2) The middle line in the box is the 2nd quartile (Q2), the median -- Half of all students completed the course in less than that many days and half of all students completed the course in more than that many days.
3) The upper end of the box is the 3rd quartile (Q3) -- 75% of all students completed the course in that many days or less and 25% took longer to complete the course.
4) The upper fence is the mathematical boundary for outliers, calculated as [Q3 + (1.5 * Inter Quartile Range)] where [Inter Quartile Range = Q3 - Q1].
5) The yellow dot is the mean number of days to complete the course. A mean greater than the median indicates a positive skew (i.e., a longer tail on the right). A mean less than the median indicates a negative skew (i.e., a longer tail on the left). Skewness was calculated as the adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient. 


**On methodology**
* This project was completed in R.
* Data was retrieved from the course search in Caseload, which limits data access to six months.
* Students who started a course more than 14 days before finishing the previous course were eliminated from the dataset. The 14 days is arbitrary. The goal was to remove the data where a student clicks to start a course long before they intend to make progress on that course.
